My solution for kaggle.com competition StumbleUponEvergreen
Uses naive bayes and boilerplate to predict results

Usage:
First run StumbleUpon.R (don't forget to change path to working dir in it)
Then you'll have 2 files 'train.txt' and 'test.txt' in correct formats
Then you can just run python file (just set output filename and last flag
as False), if you want to perform some check - just write a short script, which
separetes train sample in two randomly, so you can now check solution, just
removing two last args in main() function
Good luck ;)

Update: just fixed files contents, so just run script first, and .py next
You'll get score 0.81388. to perform some analisys or improvements - just
do some steps described above
